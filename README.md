# HTML-and-CSS
I created a vacation planner website that meets the requirements outlined for my Skills Based Assessment (SBA). The HTML and CSS Requirements are listed below. I have also commented the requirements in both the HTML and CSS files. 

Note: 
  - I used the same css file (1.1SBA.css) for both 1.1SBA.html and 1.2SBA.html

Three Pages: 
  - 1SBA.html This is my main page

Two Forms:
